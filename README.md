A comprehensive web application for diabetes prediction using machine learning, built as part of my BSc Computer Science degree. This system provides accurate risk assessment, personalised insights, and detailed explanations using **SHAP** and **LIME** to make AI transparent for healthcare professionals and patients.

> ### **Important Notice**
> This public repository contains the core logic (EDA, model training, etc.). The full Flask web application with its user interface and multi-level authentication is in a **private repository**. Please [contact me](#-contact) directly for enquiries about the complete implementation.

### üöÄ Core Features

- **Accurate Risk Prediction**: Utilises machine learning to predict diabetes risk with high precision.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Integrates SHAP, LIME, and permutation importance to explain *why* a prediction was made.
- **Multi-level User Access**: Secure roles for Admins, Doctors, and Patients, each with tailored dashboards and permissions.
- **Robust Backend**: Features secure user authentication, automated task scheduling with APScheduler, and comprehensive logging.

### üìñ Detailed User Guide & Troubleshooting

For a more detailed walkthrough of the system's features, common issues, and error handling, please expand the section below.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand User Guide</b></summary>
  
### Using the System

1.  **Login**: Use the provided test credentials for Admin, Doctor, or Patient roles.
2.  **Navigation**: The main dashboard provides a system overview. Use the navigation menu to access features specific to your user role.
3.  **Making Predictions**: Input patient data in the form, click "Predict", and view the detailed risk assessment and explanations.
4.  **Understanding Results**: The system provides probability scores and uses SHAP/LIME to show feature importance. Red indicators suggest factors that increase risk, while green indicators suggest factors that decrease it.
5.  **Viewing Visualisations**: The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section contains interactive plots.

### Troubleshooting

1.  **Common Issues**:
    -   If the application doesn't start, ensure all dependencies from `requirements.txt` are correctly installed in your virtual environment.
    -   Check if port `5000` is available on your system.
    -   Verify you are using Python 3.8 or higher.
2.  **Error Handling**:
    -   Check the `logs` directory for detailed error messages.
    -   Ensure file permissions are correctly set in the project directory.
3.  **Support**:
    -   For technical issues, first consult the logs.
    -   For access issues, contact the system administrator.
    -   For clinical questions, please consult with qualified healthcare professionals.
